# 📘 **Amazon ECR & ECS Fargate – Beginner Notes**

---

## 🐳 **What is Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)?**

* A **fully managed Docker container registry** by AWS.
* Used to **store, manage, and share Docker images** securely.
* Works like **Docker Hub**, but private and integrated with AWS.

👉 **Example**:
You build a **Node.js app** → create a Docker image → push it to **ECR repository** → later ECS Fargate pulls it from ECR to run.

**Key Points:**

* 🔒 Secure with IAM authentication
* 📦 Stores multiple versions of Docker images
* 🐳 Seamless integration with ECS & Fargate

---

## 🚀 **What is Amazon ECS Fargate?**

* **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** = AWS’s container orchestration service.
* **Fargate** = **Serverless compute engine** for containers (no servers/EC2 needed).
* You only define:

  * 📦 Which Docker image (from ECR)
  * ⚡ CPU & Memory
  * 🔄 Number of tasks
* AWS automatically runs and scales your containers.

👉 **Example**:
You want to deploy a **payment service**:

* Define a task with 512 MB RAM, 0.25 vCPU
* Deploy it with ECS Fargate → AWS runs containers across Availability Zones
* Attach Load Balancer → App is accessible to users 🌍

**Key Points:**

* 🛠️ No EC2/servers to manage
* 📈 Auto scaling for tasks
* 💰 Pay only for CPU & memory used
* 🔒 Integrated with IAM + VPC security

---

## 📝 **In Short (ECR vs ECS Fargate)**

* **ECR** 🐳 → Where you **store Docker images**
* **ECS Fargate** 🚀 → Where you **run those Docker images (serverless)**

👉 Flow = **Developer → ECR (image) → ECS Fargate (deploy & run)**

---

# 🚀 **What is ECS Fargate?**

* **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)** = A fully managed container orchestration service by AWS.
* **AWS Fargate** = A **serverless compute engine** for ECS and EKS.
* With **Fargate**, you **don’t manage servers or EC2 instances**.
* You only define **what container to run**, **how much CPU & RAM it needs**, and **how many copies (tasks) you want**.
* AWS automatically provisions compute, scales your tasks, and keeps them running.

👉 **Simple Example**:
You have a **shopping-cart app** 🛒 → create a Docker image → push it to **ECR** → deploy it using **ECS Fargate** → AWS runs it on containers across availability zones → users can access via Load Balancer.

# ⚙️ **ECS Fargate Components**

Think of ECS Fargate like a **building**. Each part plays a role 🏗️

---

### 1️⃣ **Cluster** 🏗️

* A logical grouping of tasks/services.
* Example: `ecommerce-cluster` for all microservices.

---

### 2️⃣ **Task Definition** 📝

* A **blueprint** for your application container.
* Defines:

  * Docker Image (from ECR/Docker Hub)
  * CPU & Memory
  * Ports
  * Environment variables
* Example: Blueprint of how your **shopping-cart app** should run.

---

### 3️⃣ **Task** 📦

* A **running instance** of the Task Definition.
* Example: 1 task = 1 running shopping-cart container.
* Multiple tasks = scaling horizontally.

---

### 4️⃣ **Service** 🔄

* Ensures the **desired number of tasks** are always running.
* Example: Service runs 3 tasks → even if 1 fails, ECS launches a new one automatically.
* Supports **Auto Scaling**.

---

### 5️⃣ **Networking (VPC + ENI + SG)** 🌐

* ECS Fargate tasks run inside your **VPC**.
* They get their own **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)**.
* Controlled by **Security Groups** (like firewalls).
* Can be private-only or public with Load Balancer.

---

### 6️⃣ **Load Balancer** ⚖️

* Usually an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** is used.
* Routes traffic to healthy ECS tasks.
* Example: ALB DNS `http://myapp-alb.aws.com` sends requests to available containers.

---

### 7️⃣ **IAM Roles** 🔑

* **Task Execution Role** → Lets ECS pull images from ECR & send logs to CloudWatch.
* **Task Role** → Gives the app permissions (e.g., read from S3, write to DynamoDB).

---

# 📝 **Quick Recap**

📌 **ECS Fargate = Serverless containers**
📌 **Main Components:**

* **Cluster** 🏗️ → Group of tasks
* **Task Definition** 📝 → Blueprint
* **Task** 📦 → Running container
* **Service** 🔄 → Scaling & availability
* **Networking** 🌐 → VPC, ENI, SG
* **Load Balancer** ⚖️ → Distributes traffic
* **IAM Roles** 🔑 → Security & permissions

👉 Flow = **Image from ECR → Task Definition → ECS Fargate Service → Users via Load Balancer**
