# 🚀 DevOps Scripting Essentials — Bash & Python for Real-Time Automation

> 📌 **Master practical automation with Bash & Python** — From fundamentals to real-world DevOps scripting projects.

## 📖 1. What is Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is the process of writing a series of commands in a text file (called a *script*) that can be executed by a shell interpreter (like **Bash** 🐚).
It automates repetitive tasks, simplifies complex operations, and is widely used in **system administration, application deployment, and DevOps workflows**.

---

## 💡 2. Why We Use Shell Scripting & Its Benefits

✅ **Automation** – Eliminates repetitive manual tasks.
✅ **Efficiency** – Simplifies complex commands into single execution.
✅ **Integration** – Works with tools like `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, APIs, and databases.
✅ **Cross-Platform** – Runs on most UNIX/Linux distributions.
✅ **Cost & Time Savings** – Speeds up deployments and reduces human error.

## 🐚 3. Introduction to Bash & Python Scripting

### **Bash Scripting**

Bash is a Unix shell and command language used for task automation directly on Linux/Unix environments.
It’s lightweight, fast, and ideal for system-level operations.

### **Python Scripting** 🐍

Python is a versatile high-level language, widely used for **automation, data processing, API integrations**, and **DevOps tooling**.
It’s known for its readability, large library ecosystem, and cross-platform compatibility.

## ⚔️ 4. Bash vs Python — A Quick Comparison

| Feature ⚙️        | Bash 🐚                                     | Python 🐍                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**         | Very fast for simple commands & system ops  | Slightly slower but powerful for complex logic |
| **Readability**   | Compact, but less readable for complex code | Very readable & beginner-friendly              |
| **Portability**   | Works natively on UNIX/Linux systems        | Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)         |
| **Best Use Case** | System admin tasks, file ops, server mgmt   | API calls, data processing, advanced logic     |

## 💻 6. Real-Time Projects

### **Bash Projects** 🐚

#### **1️⃣ Automated Server Backup**

**Description:** Creates daily compressed backups of important directories.
**Use Case:** Disaster recovery & data safety.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
backup_dir="/root/backup"
source_dir="/var/www/html"
mkdir -p "$backup_dir"
tar -cvzf "$backup_dir/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz" "$source_dir"
echo "✅ Backup completed successfully."
```

---

#### **2️⃣ System Health Monitoring**

**Description:** Monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage, and alerts when thresholds exceed.
**Use Case:** Prevent server downtime by early detection of resource issues.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cpu=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
disk=$(df / | grep / | awk '{ print $5 }' | sed 's/%//g')
if [ "$cpu" -gt 80 ] || [ "$disk" -gt 80 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ High resource usage detected!"
else
    echo "✅ System is healthy."
fi
```

---

#### **3️⃣ Log File Error Alerts**

**Description:** Checks logs for error keywords and sends alerts.
**Use Case:** Helps in quick incident response for production systems.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
log_file="/var/log/syslog"
if grep -qi "error" "$log_file"; then
    echo "⚠️ Errors found in system logs."
else
    echo "✅ No critical errors detected."
fi
```

---

### **Python Projects** 🐍

#### **1️⃣ Website Uptime Checker**

**Description:** Checks if a website is online and responds within a given time.
**Use Case:** Monitor production websites for outages.

```python
import requests

url = "https://example.com"
try:
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("✅ Website is UP.")
    else:
        print(f"⚠️ Website returned status {response.status_code}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
    print("❌ Website is DOWN.")
```

---

#### **2️⃣ AWS S3 Bucket Backup Script**

**Description:** Uploads local files to S3 for backup purposes.
**Use Case:** Cloud-based backup strategy.

```python
import boto3
import os

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
bucket_name = "my-backup-bucket"
folder = "/path/to/data"

for file in os.listdir(folder):
    file_path = os.path.join(folder, file)
    if os.path.isfile(file_path):
        s3.upload_file(file_path, bucket_name, file)
        print(f"✅ Uploaded {file} to S3.")
```

---

#### **3️⃣ Automated Email Alert System**

**Description:** Sends an email alert when a specific condition is met.
**Use Case:** Notify admins of critical events.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

msg = MIMEText("⚠️ High CPU usage detected on server.")
msg["Subject"] = "Server Alert"
msg["From"] = "admin@example.com"
msg["To"] = "ops@example.com"

with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.example.com") as server:
    server.login("admin@example.com", "password")
    server.sendmail(msg["From"], [msg["To"]], msg.as_string())

print("✅ Alert email sent.")
```
