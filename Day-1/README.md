## 🚀 What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a culture and set of practices that bridges **development (Dev)** and **operations (Ops)** to enable **continuous delivery** of high-quality software at speed.

> ✅ **Goal:** Faster releases, improved collaboration, and automation across the SDLC.

## 🔄 DevOps Lifecycle (CI/CD Pipeline)

The DevOps lifecycle consists of **continuous stages** that ensure smooth delivery:

📝 **Plan** → 👨‍💻 **Develop** → 🔧 **Build** → 🧪 **Test** → 🚀 **Release** → 📦 **Deploy** → 🔍 **Operate** → 📊 **Monitor**

> 🧠 *Example:* Developers push code to Git → CI server runs tests → Docker image is built → deployed to Kubernetes automatically.

## 🌱 DevOps Culture

* 💬 **Collaboration** between Dev, QA, Ops, and Security
* 🔁 **Automation** of repetitive tasks
* 🧪 **Early Testing** (Shift-left testing)
* 📉 **Fail Fast, Learn Faster**
* 📈 **Continuous Feedback** and Improvement

> *DevOps isn't just tools—it's a **mindset** of shared responsibility and agility.*
