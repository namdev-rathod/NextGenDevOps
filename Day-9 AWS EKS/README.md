## 1️⃣ What is Kubernetes? 🤔

Kubernetes (K8s) is an **open-source container orchestration platform** developed by Google (now maintained by CNCF).

👉 Think of it like an **Operating System for your containers**.
It helps you:

* 🚢 **Deploy** applications (containers) at scale
* ⚖️ **Load balance** traffic across pods
* ♻️ **Auto-heal** (restart failed containers automatically)
* 📈 **Scale up/down** based on demand
* 🔄 **Rolling updates & rollbacks** for zero-downtime deployments
* ☁️ **Cloud-agnostic** → Runs on AWS, Azure, GCP, On-Prem

|                                    | Container Runtime  | Runs containers (Docker, containerd)            | 🐳        |

---

💡 **Real-world View**:

* **Master Node** = **Project Manager** (decides, schedules, ensures deadlines).
* **Worker Node** = **Team Members** (actually do the work).
* **Pods** = **Tasks assigned to team members**.

---

## **1. Kubernetes Architecture Overview**

Kubernetes follows a **master-worker architecture**:

* **🧠 Master Node (Control Plane)**: Brain of the cluster. Manages the cluster, schedules workloads, handles API requests.
* **⚙️ Worker Node (Node)**: Executes workloads (pods), manages networking, and reports status to the master.

---

## **2. Master Node Components (Control Plane)**

The master node controls the cluster. Key components:

### **a) API Server (`kube-apiserver`) 🖥️**

* Front-end of Kubernetes control plane.
* Receives **all requests**: kubectl commands, internal controllers, and nodes.
* Validates and configures objects (pods, services).
* **Think of it as the "reception desk" of the cluster.**

---

### **b) Controller Manager (`kube-controller-manager`) ⚡**

* Runs controllers (background loops) that maintain desired state.
* Examples:

  * **Node Controller** 🖥️ monitors nodes.
  * **Replication Controller** 🔁 ensures pod replicas match desired count.
  * **Endpoint Controller** 🌐 manages service endpoints.

---

### **c) Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`) 🗓️**

* Assigns pods to worker nodes based on:

  * Resources (CPU, memory) 💻
  * Affinity rules 🧩
  * Taints & tolerations ⚠️
* Ensures workload distribution is **efficient and balanced**.

---

### **d) etcd 📦**

* Distributed key-value store.
* **Single source of truth** for cluster state.
* Stores:

  * Pod specs 🏷️
  * ConfigMaps ⚙️
  * Secrets 🔑
  * Service info 🌐

---

### **e) CoreDNS 🌐**

* Internal DNS service.
* Resolves service names → IP addresses.
* Example: Pod can reach service `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`.

---

### **f) Optional Components**

* **Cloud Controller Manager ☁️**: Integrates cloud resources.
* **Metrics Server 📊**: Collects metrics for autoscaling.

---

## **3. Worker Node Components ⚙️**

Worker nodes **run the actual workloads**:

### **a) Kubelet 🤖**

* Agent running on each node.
* Ensures pods are running as defined by API server.
* Reports node & pod status back to master.

---

### **b) Kube-proxy 🌐**

* Handles networking & service routing.
* Implements ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.
* Routes traffic to pods inside or across nodes.

---

### **c) Container Runtime 🐳**

* Runs containers (Docker, containerd, CRI-O).
* Kubelet communicates with it to manage containers.

---

### **d) Node-level Add-ons**

* **cAdvisor 📊**: Monitors resource usage.
* **Fluentd / Logging Agent 📝**: Collects logs.
* **Network Plugins (CNI) 🌉**: Pod-to-pod networking.

---

## **4. Master ↔ Worker Node Interaction Flow**

1. **User request** → API Server 🖥️ (`kubectl apply`)
2. **API Server** validates request → stores in etcd 📦
3. **Scheduler 🗓️** assigns pod to worker node ⚙️
4. **Controller Manager ⚡** ensures desired state
5. **Kubelet 🤖** launches pod on worker
6. **Kube-proxy 🌐** sets networking rules
7. Status updates → API Server → etcd

✅ **Summary:**

* **Master 🧠:** Controls the cluster → API Server, Controller, Scheduler, etcd, CoreDNS.
* **Worker ⚙️:** Runs workloads → Kubelet, Kube-proxy, Container Runtime.
* **Flow:** Master decides → Worker executes → Status reported → Master updates etcd.

---

## **1️⃣ Pods 🟢**

**What is it?**

* The **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.
* A pod can have **one or more containers** running together.
* Containers in the same pod **share network, storage, and can talk to each other** via `localhost`.

**Real-time analogy:**
Think of a **pod as an apartment** 🏠. You can live alone (single container) or with roommates (multiple containers), and you all share the same address (IP) and utilities (volumes).

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-first-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

* This pod runs **1 nginx container**.
* You can access it via `kubectl get pods` and see it running.

---

## **2️⃣ Deployment 📦**

**What is it?**

* Manages **pods lifecycle**.
* Ensures a **desired number of replicas** are always running.
* Can do **rolling updates, rollbacks**.

**Analogy:**
Think of deployment as a **manager at a restaurant** 👨‍💼. You tell him “I need 3 chefs at all times,” and if one chef leaves, he hires a new one immediately.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

* This ensures **3 pods** are always running.
* If one pod dies, Kubernetes automatically replaces it.

---

## **3️⃣ ReplicaSet 🔄**

**What is it?**

* Ensures a **specific number of pod replicas** are running.
* Usually **managed by Deployment**, but can be used alone.

**Analogy:**
ReplicaSet is like a **team roster** 📝 ensuring there are always X players on the field. Deployment is the **coach** managing it.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
```

---

## **4️⃣ DaemonSet 🖥️**

**What is it?**

* Ensures **one pod runs on every node** (or selected nodes) in a cluster.
* Useful for **monitoring, logging, or networking services**.

**Analogy:**
Think of **a security camera on every floor of a building** 🎥. Each floor gets one, no more, no less.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluentd-daemon
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: fluentd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: fluentd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: fluentd
        image: fluentd:latest
```

* This runs **Fluentd logging agent on every node**.

---

## **5️⃣ Stateless vs Stateful Pods 🆚**

### **Stateless Pods**

* No memory of past interactions.
* Any pod can handle a request.
* Examples: **Web servers, API servers**.

**Analogy:**
Stateless pod is like a **fast-food cashier** 🍔 – doesn’t remember past orders, serves anyone who comes.

### **Stateful Pods**

* Keeps state/data across restarts.
* Pods have **persistent identity and storage**.
* Examples: **Databases like MySQL, Kafka**.

**Analogy:**
Stateful pod is like a **bank account manager** 💼 – remembers your history and account info.

---

## **6️⃣ Headless Service 🛠️**

* A service without a ClusterIP.
* Used to **directly access pods** (common with stateful apps).

**Analogy:**
Think of it as **giving your friend your personal phone number instead of the company switchboard** ☎️.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mydb
spec:
  clusterIP: None  # Headless
  selector:
    app: mydb
  ports:
    - port: 3306
```

---

## **7️⃣ Ingress 🌐**

**What is it?**

* Manages **external access** to services inside the cluster.
* Supports **routing, SSL termination, and host-based rules**.

**Analogy:**
Ingress is like the **reception desk of an office building** 🏢 – it routes visitors to the correct room based on their request.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: nginx-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

* Requests to `myapp.example.com` → routed to `nginx-service`.
