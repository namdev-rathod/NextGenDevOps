## 5️⃣ Don’t Depend on a Single Tech Stack

> ✅ DevOps ≠ Only Linux or AWS

You’ll need hands-on exposure to:

- 🧱 Infrastructure (Terraform, CDK)  
- ☁️ Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- 🔁 CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab)  
- 📦 Containers (Docker, Kubernetes)

## 6️⃣ Real-World DevOps Workflow

> A DevOps Engineer **doesn't just run scripts** — they **build systems**.

Here’s how the real world works:

- **Infra provisioning** → Terraform / CDK  
- **CI/CD setup** → Git-based automation (Jenkins, GitHub)  
- **Containerization** → Docker, ECR, ECS/K8s  
- **Monitoring & Logging** → Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, ELK  
- **Release Management** → Blue/Green, Canary deployments  
- **Collaboration** → Agile + GitOps

---
