## üåê 1. What is an IP Address?

An **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)** uniquely identifies a device on a network.

### üîπ Types of IPs:

* **Private IP:** Used in internal/local networks (e.g., `192.168.0.0/16`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`)
* **Public IP:** Globally routable IP for accessing over the internet (e.g., `8.8.8.8`)

### üîπ Check Your IP:

```bash
ip a                  # Show local (private) IP
curl ifconfig.me      # Show public IP
```

## üß± 2. Linux Networking Basics

Linux provides powerful tools to interact with networking components.

### üîπ Common Commands:

| Command             | Description                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `ip a`              | Show all IPs and interfaces          |
| `ip r`              | View routing table                   |
| `ping <host>`       | Test network connectivity            |
| `traceroute <host>` | Trace route to destination           |
| `netstat -tulnp`    | Show open ports (legacy)             |
| `ss -tuln`          | Show open ports (modern replacement) |
| `nslookup <domain>` | DNS query                            |
| `dig <domain>`      | Advanced DNS lookup                  |

---

## üåê 3. DNS - Domain Name System

DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `google.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses.

### üîπ Test DNS:

```bash
nslookup google.com
dig google.com
cat /etc/resolv.conf  # DNS resolver config
```

---

## üî• 4. Firewall

A **firewall** filters inbound and outbound traffic based on defined rules.

### üîπ Common Ports:

| Port | Protocol |
| ---- | -------- |
| 22   | SSH      |
| 80   | HTTP     |
| 443  | HTTPS    |

### üîπ Check Firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw status           # Ubuntu
sudo firewall-cmd --state # RHEL/CentOS
```

---

## üîÅ 5. NAT - Network Address Translation

NAT allows multiple devices with private IPs to access the internet using a single public IP.

### üîπ Usage:

* Home/Office Routers
* AWS NAT Gateway
* Docker bridge networks

### üîπ Docker NAT Example:

```bash
docker run -d nginx
docker inspect <container_id> | grep IPAddress
curl http://localhost
```

---

## üß∞ 6. Proxy Servers

A **proxy** is an intermediary server between a client and another server.

### üîπ Types:

* **Forward Proxy:** Controls outbound traffic (corporate firewalls)
* **Reverse Proxy:** Controls inbound traffic and routes to backend services (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy)

### üîπ Set Proxy (Temp):

```bash
export http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
export https_proxy=https://proxy.example.com:8080
```

## üß± OSI Model ‚Äì 7 Networking Layers

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model describes how data moves through a network, broken into 7 layers. Each layer has its specific function and interacts only with the layers directly above and below it.

### üìä OSI Layer Table

| Layer | Layer Name         | Description                                                                                                         | Examples                                    |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 7     | Application Layer  | Interfaces with end-user applications; responsible for network services to applications.                            | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS                        |
| 6     | Presentation Layer | Translates, encrypts, or compresses data from the application layer.                                                | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG                         |
| 5     | Session Layer      | Manages sessions or connections between applications.                                                               | NetBIOS, RPC                                |
| 4     | Transport Layer    | Provides reliable data transfer via segmentation, error detection, and flow control.                                | TCP, UDP                                    |
| 3     | Network Layer      | Routes packets across networks and handles logical addressing.                                                      | IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP                        |
| 2     | Data Link Layer    | Transfers data between devices on the same network; handles MAC addressing and error correction at the frame level. | Ethernet, PPP, Switch                       |
| 1     | Physical Layer     | Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium.                                                                  | Cables, Hubs, Network Interface Cards (NIC) |
